:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of Garden Linux. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS).

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the official website at [https://apeirora.eu/](https://apeirora.eu/).
